# PotMatch

PotMatch is a compact sensor–actuator embedded system built around an Arduino Nano.
It uses a potentiometer as an analog input device and provides layered feedback using LEDs, a passive buzzer, and a 16×2 I2C LCD. With the primary simple sensor actuator system being the potentiometer and the LED respectively, with an LCD and buzzer connected to this output. The system evaluates how closely the user matches a hidden analog target value and progressively indicates proximity through a multi-stage feedback pattern. It is a compact, carriable game, ready to provide challenge and fun. 

This project demonstrates real time signal acquisition, stable input detection, non-blocking actuator control, and level based interaction logic in a small, self-contained module.

1. Features

Analog Input Handling

Reads a potentiometer (A0) continuously.

Accepts a value only when the input is stable for 500 ms.

Supports a wide input range and removes jitter during knob movement.


Multi-Stage LED Feedback

The system uses six LEDs:

3 red (far)

1 red (mid)

2 green (close)

3 green (exact)


LED patterns update based on the user’s proximity to the hidden target value.

Audio Cues

A passive buzzer generates:

Distinct tones for each “distance band”

A structured, non-blocking win melody on correct match


Display Output

A 16×2 I2C LCD shows:

Level selection

Real-time timer (levels with countdown)

Number of tries (levels with limited attempts)

Text feedback matching the LED states

Win and fail messages


Difficulty Levels (1–5)

Each level modifies:

Time limit

Width of the “winning zone”

Allowed number of attempts

Target value reset per round.


Levels unlock sequentially after successful completion.

Button Interaction

Short presses: cycle through levels

Long press: confirm selected level

Idle long press: reset to welcome screen

Menu and in-game logic are fully non-blocking


Automatic Idle Sleep:

If unused for 36 seconds, the LCD turns off and the system enters a low activity mode.
Pressing the button wakes it.

4. System Logic Summary

1. User selects a level using button short presses.


2. Long press begins the level.


3. A random target value is generated.


4. Potentiometer input is monitored until stable.


5. System determines proximity state based on difference:

Far → 3 red LEDs + low tone

Mid → 1–2 red LEDs

Close → 1–2 green LEDs

Exact → 3 green LEDs + win melody



6. LCD displays explanatory text for each state.


7. Timer and attempts decrease per rules of the selected level.


8. Win unlocks next level.


9. After inactivity, system enters sleep mode.
